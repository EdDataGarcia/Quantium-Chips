# Chips Category Review from Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Program via Forage

This repository contains my completed solution to the Quanitum Virtual Experience Program hosted on Forage.

Explanation of Files:
- If you just want to access the final presentation, you can access Task 3 (PDF or PowerPoint).
- For other Quantium students / code-seekers, you can access my R code for Task 1, Task 2, or Task 3 by clicking on the respective PDF or R Markdown file.

Brief Overview of how I completed the project:
- Recommended a grocery store productâ€™s target demographic through hypothesis testing and affinity analysis using R Studio
- Identified control stores that test the impact of trial store layouts by creating R functions and using t-values 
- Beautified presentations using R Markdown and PowerPoint to report recommendations for the client
